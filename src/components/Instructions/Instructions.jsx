        <div className="item text-body">1. Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
  You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</div>
        <div className="item text-body">2. Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</div>
        <div className="item text-body">3. Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
  the eggs evenly coat the surface.</div>
        <div className="item text-body">4. Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
  middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</div>
        <div className="item text-body">5. Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</div>
        <div className="item text-body">6. Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</div>
